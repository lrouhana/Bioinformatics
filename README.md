## Rouhana_phylotocol_template_v1.0.pdf
This document serves as an a priori established protocol ([phylotocol](https://github.com/josephryan/phylotocol)) laying out our planned phylogenetic experiments to test whether the cpeb orthologs are present in metazoan genomes exclusively or also in non metazoans genomes. Close homologs to CPEB that are not orthologous will be cataloged during analysis. NOTE: ammendments to this protocol will be included as appendices in a new version of this document.
